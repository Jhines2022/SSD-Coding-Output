# Development Team Project: Coding Output
----
# Project description 
This document backs and clarifies the integration of the required computer software components, bringing the conceptualized secure software design submitted at the end of Unit 3 of the Secure Software Development Module for the University of Essex Online into the production environment developed for the Dutch Police Internet Forensics Department. Cyber forensics departments perform computer-related evidence collection, analysis, preservation, and presentation to investigate network vulnerabilities and criminal, fraud, counterintelligence, or law enforcement activities (NICSS, n.d). As per these requirements, the illustrated solution can add/remove users and, depending on the user group they belong to, upload/download files to be used accordingly by the respective legislative authority.
<br/>
# Requirements 

## Install the following
* Python v3.10.6 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* PyCharm IDE (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)) 
* Django web framework with Tailwind for css
* Node.js 
<br/>

# How to implement the project

* Download zip file and extract files
* Open Pycharm, click projects, new project
* Open location folder, choose project folder, ok
* Create from existing source, open terminal, select + next to local to open a local 2
----
> **`IMPORTANT`, Please read!** This program is run locally and requires 3 different commands to be run in the terminal within the Pycharm IDE 
### The 3 commands are:

* venv\Scripts\activate  
* python manage.py tailwind start 
* python manage.py runserver.

Watch the video then Copy and paste commands from above.
